# Differential Expression Analysis Exercise

Hallo dear candidate,

We would like you to perform an exercise to test your knowledge of single-cell analysis.

## Exercise Description

The exercise involves performing a differential expression analysis from a dataset obtained from a singlecell dataset. You can download the dataset from the following link:

[Download Dataset](https://cf.10xgenomics.com/samples/cell/pbmc3k/pbmc3k_filtered_gene_bc_matrices.tar.gz)

The experiment is based on a tutorial from R's Seurat package, which you can find here:

### Objectives

1. Perform differential expression analysis by comparing two clusters.
2. Perform differential expression analysis of one cluster against the rest of the cells.
3. Perform differential expression analysis of two clusters defined as squares (minX1, maxX1, minY1, maxY1 and minX2, maxX2, minY2, maxY2) where the x and y are the axial coordinates of UMAP_1 and UMAP_2.

### Important Note

These analyses must prioritize speed over data accuracy. The computation time should be as fast as possible. While accuracy is important, the primary goal is to obtain results in a timely manner, and the results should still be plausible.

You have the flexibility to operate on the original dataset to make it as lightweight as possible. Additionally, you can use any optimization methods available. Any R package can be used for the analyses.

## Happy Testing!
